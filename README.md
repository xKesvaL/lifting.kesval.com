# SupaPower

## ***Project is on standby for now***

Why ? Well, I don't think I have the right idea fur SupaPower right now. Some things are sure, great, and I won't ditch the project directly, but I think it needs improvements.

I know no real code nor functionality has been written yet, but I think we need to have another ecosystem other than the one I had in mind.

I think we have to add 2 main categories other than Body, powerlifting and powerbuilding. Things such as Athleticism and Calisthenics would be a great addition.

Now I don't have any idea how to program for these 2 categories, so what should we do about that ? I Thought about an ecosystem where people could share their programs. Evidently, this requires way more work than what I was expecting at first, but I think it's the right choice.

I'll be doing other projects in the meantime, but I'll be back to SupaPower, and I'll try to make it the best I can. I also think we need to redo the design of the FirstJoinFlow.

Be back soon !
